# Nagbox
** Recurring reminders for wayward creatives. **

Nagbox is a small app designed to do one thing: nag you repeatedly when you waste your time and lose track of it. Just set up a recurring reminder, enable it when you start slacking, and you’ll never ever wonder where your time has gone.

Actually, this is a really simple app made for three reasons:

1. A sample for my upcoming Medium articles on various Android development and design patterns (e.g. the first one will be on SQLite integration approach);
2. A playground to get familiar with new things (e.g. data binding, N notifications);
3. Actually, I need an app like this myself, and it’s quite possible that I’ll further develop it into a complete full-featured app. Think of it as an MVP developed in under a week.
